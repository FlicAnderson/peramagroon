The original thesis was on the vegetation of Peramagroon Mountain in Iraqi Kurdistan, and was completed in August 2013.\r\n\r\n:seedling: \r\n\r\nIt will contain my data, data cleaning/tidying and analysis scripts, figures, and manuscripts. I'm also aiming to make everything reproducible and openly accessible, so I'll also detail these factors and include notes on how I do this. I'm hoping that I'll learn a lot from this experiment, and that the data I collected and results and conclusions I come to will be useful.\r\n\r\n:deciduous_tree:\r\n\r\n> \"I do not fear computers.

Little is known about the oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands on the lower slopes of Peramagroon, or their vegetation structure. This study surveyed three sites, using transects and releves at each site, in order to survey the woodland and its flora, collecting taxa abundance data and a range of environmental variables. Significant variation was found to exist in the vegetation structure of the oak woodland, with two sub-communities identified and indicator species determined for these. Woodland management (including oak coppice) was investigated for its potential effect on vegetation, and was found to significantly influence woodland structure and density. Grazing presence was shown not to vary significantly with vegetation groupings or composition. A rapid-survey protocol for identification of vegetation sub-communities and surveying the effects of grazing occurrence and intensity in oak woodlands across the Zagros Mountain Forest Steppe ecoregion within Iraqi Kurdistan has been recommended.\r\n\r\n## Further Project Info:\r\n... to be added ...\r\n\r\n## Project License: \r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons Licence\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">Peramagroon Mountain Vegetation Project</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"https://github.com/FlicAnderson/peramagroon\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Felicity Anderson</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n\r\n## Project DOI: \r\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12271.png)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12271)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12271\"><img src=\"https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12271.png\" alt=\"10.5281/zenodo.12271\"></a>\r\n\r\n![Project DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.12271.png)","google":"UA-55858110-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

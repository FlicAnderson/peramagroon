### Flic's MSc Thesis Data &amp; Analysis:   
#### An experiment in reproducible research &amp; open data

This data was collected over three weeks in May-June 2013 by me (Felicity Anderson) in Iraqi Kurdistan for my MSc thesis project

**AIMS**: 

  * re-organise raw data from several rather disorganised spreadsheets into one (or at least fewer!) useful files
  * sort and tidy these data 
  * re-analyse the tidied data using R statistical programming language, for the analyses outlined in my thesis
  * carry out additional analyses
  * write up (and publish?)
  * learn more about: 
    * R stats
    * Data analysis
    * Literate statistical programming and markdown
    * Github / version control
    * Open data
    * Reproducible Research
